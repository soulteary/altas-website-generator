## Introduction


> Tengine is a web server originated by [Taobao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taobao), the largest e-commerce website in Asia. It is based on the [Nginx](http://nginx.org) HTTP server and has many advanced features. Tengine has proven to be very stable and efficient on some of the top 100 websites in the world, including [taobao.com](http://www.taobao.com) and [tmall.com](http://www.tmall.com/). 

> Tengine has been an open source project since December 2011. It is being actively developed by the Tengine team, whose core members are from [Taobao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taobao), [Sogou](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sogou) and other Internet companies. Tengine is a community effort and everyone is encouraged to [get involved](source.html).</div>

## Features

*   All features of Nginx-1.8.1 are inherited, i.e., it is compatible with Nginx.
*   [Dynamic module loading support (DSO)](document/dso.html). You don't have to recompile Tengine when adding new modules to it.
*   [HTTP/2 support](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_v2_module.html). The ngx_http_v2_module supersedes the ngx_http_spdy_module module.
*   Sends [unbuffered upload](document/http_core.html) directly to HTTP and FastCGI backend servers, which saves disk I/Os.
*   More load balancing methods, e.g., [consistent hashing](document/http_upstream_consistent_hash.html), [session persistence](document/http_upstream_session_sticky.html), [upstream health check](document/http_upstream_check.html), and [resolving upstream domain names on the fly](document/http_upstream_dynamic.html).
*   [Input body filter](http://blog.zhuzhaoyuan.com/2012/01/a-mechanism-to-help-write-web-application-firewalls-for-nginx/) support. It's quite handy to write Web Application Firewalls using this mechanism.
*   [Dynamic scripting language (Lua)](https://github.com/alibaba/tengine/blob/master/modules/ngx_http_lua_module/README.markdown) support, which is very efficient and makes it easy to extend core functionalities.
*   Support [collecting the running status of Tengine](document/http_reqstat.html) according to specific key (domain, url, etc).
*   [Limits retries for upstream servers](document/ngx_limit_upstream_tries.html) (proxy, memcached, fastcgi, scgi, uwsgi).
*   Includes a mechanism to support [standalone processes](document/proc.html).
*   [Protects the server](document/http_sysguard.html) in case system load or memory use goes too high.
*   [Multiple CSS or JavaScript requests can be combined](document/http_concat.html) into one request to reduce download time.
*   [Removes unnecessary white spaces and comments](document/http_trim_filter.html) to reduce the size of a page.
*   The number of worker processes and CPU affinities can be set automatically.
*   [The limit_req module](document/http_limit_req.html) is enhanced with whitelist support and more conditions are allowed in a single location.
*   [Enhanced diagnostic information](document/http_footer_filter.html) makes it easier to troubleshoot errors.
*   [More user-friendly command lines](document/commandline.html), e.g., showing all compiled-in modules and supported directives.
*   Expiration times can be specified for certain MIME types.
*   Error pages can be reset to 'default'.
